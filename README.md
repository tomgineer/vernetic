# Vernetic CSS Framework

![Vernetic](hero.webp)

Hey there!  
Welcome to the **Vernetic CSS Framework** â€” handcrafted since **2017**, open-sourced in the year of our nerd 2025, and finally, _finally_, with actual documentation.

If you've ever thought _"I wish I had a clean, modern, no-nonsense CSS framework I could actually read and extend without needing a PhD in utility class memorization"_, youâ€™re in the right place.

> âœ¨ Vernetic is built with love, SASS, and stubborn refusal to use Bootstrap.

```

### JavaScript

Also in your `<head>` (with `defer`, because performance is cool):

```

### Icon Sprite

Anywhere in your `<body>`:

```html
<svg class="svg-icon">
  <use href="#box"></use>
</svg>
```

## Why Vernetic?

Because I needed a framework that:

- Didnâ€™t fight me.
- Played nice with modern CSS.
- Wasnâ€™t 1MB of opinionated bloat.
- And looked âœ¨ sharp âœ¨.

So I made it.
