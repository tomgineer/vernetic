## Fast, Smart, Robust, Open Source CSS Framework

#### A font, color, size, icon system that makes your life easier.

Vernetic CSS Framework was previously known as VerdinCSS. It has been evolving continuously since 2017 and is used in both the private and government sectors of various countries.

## Why?

The truth is that for years I've been building pages or applications using Bootstrap. I also tried Foundation.

The above two Projects are amazing but when your applications become bigger and more complex you start missing things. You want to modify more, your requirements increase.

When I decided to write a complete CMS from scratch I had to create the Frontend as well. I decided that since I was going to write a complete CMS it would be a good idea to write the CSS framework with which I would implement it.

No, it wasn't easy. It took me several years, thousands of tests and fixes. In every Project I used it I added, changed, improved something. Until I came up with what I use today, what I share with you here.

## Who?

I don't know if it matters who I am. I'm a programmer with decades of experience. Code has been a passion since the first day I wrote my first lines in Quick Basic. At the age of 15. Many years later, the passion remains unchanged.

I am what they call a Full-Stack Developer. Programming everything from interfaces, to applications, designing and managing large databases.

I grew up in Greece. A country that definitely inspires you to make the world a better place. The reason I became a professional programmer. Together with friends we founded the first Linux community in Greece. Wild times back then to set up a computer with this relatively new operating system. I got a family and a beautiful daughter. I immigrated to Germany where I work until now.

## Where?

In the future of course I will probably add CDNs and other ways of embedding.

The Project is Open Source so you can use it freely for personal or professional use. You can even Fork it and create your own version.
